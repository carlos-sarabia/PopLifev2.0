## Welcome to PopLifev2.0!

**PopLife** is a pipeline designed to quickly compute multiple population-genetic statistics, including measures of genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and selection scans, using VCF files from a wide range of species.

This new version of PopLife works with VCF files that include the **PL (Phred-scaled genotype likelihood)** field and requires a reference genome in FASTA format. It relies on the following software packages:

- ANGSD

- PLINK2

- Beagle

- selscan

An online browser is available at **poplife.omicsuab.org**, where results can be visualized and explored interactively.

We welcome collaborations! If you would like your population VCF data to be processed and visualized in PopLife, feel free to get in touch.

PopLife is a pipeline designed to quickly calculate several statistics of genetic diversity, genetic differentiation and selection scans based on VCF files from several species. 

This version of PopLife uses VCF files with PL (Phred-scaled genotype Likelihood) field and a reference genome (in .fasta). It uses the following software packages:

- ANGSD
- PLINK2
